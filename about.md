<p>Welcome to my blog Primarium.IO </p>
<p>I am Justin Isbell, a software Developer and aspiring triathlete based in Colorado Springs, Colorado. I am a father to two and husband to one wonderful wife.
</p>

<p>This blog was origionally to be about my tech work but I found myself wanting to write more and more about my faith, my tri training, and whatever else I want, so youll find those kinds of things here.</p>

<p>Feel free to browse my posts and see my current and past projects. Feel free to contact me with any inquiries over using my work in your project or collaborating on a new project.</p>

<p>You can contact me <a class="aboutlink" href="https://www.primarium.io/contact">here</a> or at justin@primarium.io</p>
