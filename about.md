<p>Welcome to my blog Primarium.IO </p>
<p>I am Justin Isbell, a software Developer based in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Since I am a software developer you can expect me to share quite a few posts regarding software development but 
dont be surprised to run into a few of my posts relating to my other interests, which are, woodworking, philanthropy, and education.</p>

<p>Feel free to browse my posts and see my current and past projects. Feel free to contact me with any inquiries over using my work in your project or collaborating on a new project.</p>

<p>You can contact me <a class="aboutlink" href="http://www.primarium.io/contact">here</a> or at justin@primarium.io</p>

For a little more about me here are a few posts that focus on me:

<a class="aboutlink" href="http://primarium.io/primarium/general/2016/09/06/welcome-to-primarium.html">Welcome to Primarium</a>

<a class="aboutlink" href="http://primarium.io/p/primarium/general/2016/09/07/my-philosophy.html">My Philosophy</a>

If you see a link like <span class="defclick" data-target="/def/Example-Def.html">THIS</span> give it a click(or a tap) and you should get a popup on your screen explaining that word. I do this to try to make my site more accessible to less technical folks.
