I have written about cycling before but thi is my first real post on fitness. My wonderful wife and I have decided to train for a triathlon together. Over the last year we have really gotten into working out and getting more fit. I really enjoy cycling and my wife really enjoys swimming. We decided to let our forces combine a little bit and try out triathlons.

We are starting with a sprint triathlon which is a 750m swim a 20k bike ride and a 5k run. This is the shortest standard distance try which is why we are starting with that. We are starting short so we can tune our training to build over time. One of the first things we learned getting into this is that increasing distances and volume too quickly is not saf and can lead to injury. So here we go training for what is called a sprint triathlon. Ill come back and post about my training plan and equipment and other things. 

Today is day 1 of my official training so lets hope it goes well!
