Swimming is Hard, but **Swimming Wrong is Harder**

I've been working out my knee issues and one thing that came to light is that my swimming is actually causing some of the problems. The reason for that is because I was kicking horribly wrong. My legs were playing out way too wide and it was causing some of my knee problems. The frustrating part of this process is that I am now learning to kick correctly and its pretty much forced me to relearn how to swim. My endurance has dropped and I've signed up for a masters swim course.

While relearning a skill you thought you had figured out to a degree isn't fun, it turns out continuing to do the wrong things over and over again are frustrating. The real lesson though is that the consequences of doing this wrong were worse and could have even wound up injuring me had I not stopped.
