Welcome to my Blog. I hope you find the articles interesting and that you are both educated and encouraged on while here. MY intent with this blog is to share my ideas for technology and development and in particular how they can be used for positive change. If you even have any feedback please feel free to contact me and let me know your thoughts. I welcome any feedback, crtitical or encouraging. If your comments are meaningful or constructive in some way I may append them to the bottom of my post. 

#### **A little about me:**

I am a self educated software developer. I spent most of my career so far working at DineEquity, a restaurant franchising company. I recently started working at Compassion International, a faith based non-profit based in Colorado Springs. 

 I am a fan of both open and closed source solutions and I favor C# ASP.NET frameworks for back end programming most of the time, however I am also a big fan of Node.JS. This Blog is written using Jekyll a ruby based satic site generator.

#### I may at times include code snippets in my blog such as the one below:

{% highlight c# %}
// Hello1.cs
public class Hello1
{
   public static void Main()
   {
      System.Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}


I will make an attempt to provide perspective on most topics that allows both technical and non-technical individuals to gain something from each article. If you felt an article was overly techical or not detailed enough please let me know and I'll make an effort to talk you through the details or even update the post If I failed in some major way.

Thanks for stopping by and I hope you enjoy your time on my site!
