Welcome to my Blog. I hope you find the articles interesting and that you are both educated and encouraged on while here. My goal is to focus mainly on software development and new technology but its possible I may branche out into other topics. If you even have any feedback please feel free to contact me and let me know your thoughts. I welcome any feedback, crtitical or encouraging. If your comments are meaningful or constructive in some way I may append them to the bottom of my post. 

#### **A little about me:**

I am a self educated software developer. I attended one semester at the University of Kansas but then dropped out to do family circumstances and the fact that I hated it. I spent most of my career so far working at DineEquity a restaurant franchising company. I recently started working at Compassion International, a faith based non-profit based in Colorado Springs. 

I am a devout Christian and I believe that technology can be a great tool to make the world a better place. I'll not be discussing topics of the political or controverisal theological nature on this blog. My goal is that the world be a better place, not a more argued one. I am a fan of both open and closed source solutions and I favor C# ASP.NET frameworks for back end programming most of the time, however I am also a big fan of Angular 2. 

#### I may at times include code snippets in my blog such as the one below:

{% highlight c# %}
// Hello1.cs
public class Hello1
{
   public static void Main()
   {
      System.Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}


I will make an attempt to provide two perspectives on most topics, an overview topics for those interested in topics I discuss but maybe not the more technical aspects. The second perspective will be the more technical "under the hood" Perspective. Sometimes this will be in the form of a dropdown to view more details or it may be another post. If you felt an article was overly techical or not detailed enough please let me know and I'll make an effort to talk you through the details or even update the post If I failed in some major way.

Thanks for stopping by and I hope you enjoy your time on my site!
