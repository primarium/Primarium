<strong>What is a Maker? </strong>
Why would I want to be a Maker? I've asked these questions plenty of times. The term "Maker" 
has always irritated me for how broad and generic it sounds. I've made wood furniture for years and yet I'd never 
call myself a "maker".  Most of the time though we associate people who are makers with two things: 3D Printing, 
and CNC's. Have I already lost you? Don't worry, I'll be jumping into what those are and much more before all is said and done.

For now, let me take you through what I want to do and why. As I said before I have made wood furniture for a while. 
I've started making a few smaller wood things to sell and I've found myself wanting to speed up certain tasks and to be able to 
do some details I can't do by hand. Those wishes led me to want a CNC. What is a CNC? A CNC is a machine that takes instructions 
from a computer to cut out your designs out of whatever material you put in front of it.  

Introducing the <a href="http://www.vicious1.com/specifications/">Mostly Printed CNC(MPCNC)</a> which I think is one of the neatest things to
 come out of this whole Maker movement. Like its name implies the MPCNC is a CNC that is built at home, to dimensions you get to choose.
  The printer is designed to use cheap EMC conduit as its guide rails and the structural parts are 3D printed parts.
   You go out and buy all the metal and electronic parts and then you just print the rest of it on a 3d printer. 

If like me, you do not have a 3d printer you have two choices. For $190 you can buy the parts from the guy who
 invented the CNC or find someone with a printer to print them for you. The other choice is to buy a 3d printer. 
 Initially, I was going to just buy the parts. I wasn't interested in 3d printing, it wasn't something I really wanted to do. 
 I assumed 3d printers would be a good $1,000 just for something that could print the parts. 

Well, you know what they say about assumptions. It turns out there are a lot of 3d printers out there for less than
 $400 that can print the parts for the MPCNC. This makes things much more interesting. Do you want to spend just the 190 and get one 
 set of parts, or do you want to spend 400 and get something that can make an indefinite number of parts? This led me down the path of
  becoming a maker, because as you can guess, I'd rather be able to make more parts because, well, I tend to break things and being able
   to replace the parts without crying seemed wise. I'm my upcoming posts I'll take you with me through my journey from having no
    3d printer and no CNC to the finish line of having both working. 

I'll give my learnings and thoughts on entry level printers as a complete beginner to this space. 
I hope to get to the point of being able to make high-quality items using both products. 
Things that are strong, functional, and serve a useful purpose. Let's see how it goes.
